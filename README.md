All my Kaggle kernels (all made public jupyter notebooks in python) as a competition contributor

## Home Credit Default Risk: [Notebook](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels/blob/master/Home-Credit/Kaggle/Home_credit_default_risk.ipynb) - [PDF](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels/blob/master/Home-Credit/Kaggle/Home_credit_default_risk.pdf)
* Concept : Predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan
* Type : Standard supervised binary classification task (RandomForrest, LightGBM, XGBoost models) using the area under the ROC curve as metric
* Dataset : previous credits provided by other financial institutions, POS (point of sales) and cash loans, snapshots of credit cards, previous applications and repayment history.
* Goals :
  * Deal with imbalanced dataset.
  * Make prediction when accuracy is not the best metric (ROC AUC is a better representation of model performance)
  * Features analysis and importances

## Customer Segmentation: [Notebook](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels/blob/master/Customer%20Segmentation%20-%20K-Means%20Analysis/k_means.ipynb) - [PDF](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels/blob/master/Customer%20Segmentation%20-%20K-Means%20Analysis/k_means.pdf)
* Concept : customer segmentation, also known as market basket analysis
* Type : Unsupervised machine learning technique (KMeans Clustering Model)
* Dataset : CustomerID,Gender,Age, Annual Income (k$) &	Spending Score from a supermarket mall customers
* Goals :
  * How to achieve customer segmentation using KMeans Clustering.
  * Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy easy to converse.
  * How the marketing strategy works in real world
