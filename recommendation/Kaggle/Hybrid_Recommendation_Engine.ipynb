    "This data set consists of: * 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. * Each user has rated at least 20 movies. * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)\n",

    "    \n",
    "_It is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas, and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating._"

    "\n",
    "_It is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood [...]._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Advantage: it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself [...]._\n",
    "\n",
    "__Content-based filtering__\n",
    "\n",
    "_It is based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences. This methods is best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features._\n",
    "\n",
    "_In this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. This algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.[...]_\n",
